# My Damn Employees
This highly enjoyable form is designed to allow employers to keep track of just how expensive all of their employees are on a monthly basis.  Though this may be a depressing task at first, there is good news.  Through the 'Fire this one' button, an employer can immediately see how much his expenditures go down if they were to fire this employee.  This is a highly satisfying and motivating endeavor, and I encourage you to play around with it.

### Entering an employee
Make sure to fill out all of the required information for each employee, including:
- First name
- Last Name
- ID Number
- Job Title
- Yearly salary

Please note, the ID Number should be a unique identifier for each employee.  If you do not assign ID Numbers, just make something up and make sure it is unique!

### Deleting an employee
This is the happiest feature of this website.  If an employee is fired, or if you are curious how firing an employee will affect your bottom line, simply click the 'Fire this one?' button to delete them from your list.  Delete the wrong person?  Simply add that person's information back in.

### Monthly salary expenditures
This is the saddest feature of the website.  Still, it is a necessary one in business.  The displayed amount is how much it will cost you per month to employ all of your inferiors (and yourself if you choose to be added to this list).

Good luck tracking your employees, and I hope this form helps you fire your way to lower monthly expenses.
